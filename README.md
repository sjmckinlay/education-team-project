# education-team-project
This project was composed in RStudio, as a collaboration with K. Jones at UW.

We studied the correlation of crime rates in the US, as sampled as individual states, to unemployment rates, population density, and per-pupil spending on K-12 students.

This project was overseen and given feedback by Dr. M. Kennedy, as the final project for the "Regression Modeling with Applications" 400-level course.
